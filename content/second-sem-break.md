As usual, in this vacation of semester break , I enjoyed by learning something new to me (known unknown and some unknown unknown technologies) , reading books , visiting to countryside , discovering new music and I also found something amazing thing that may help in the learning process that  I will discuss at the end of this article.

### Video Conferencing App

I started vacation by learning about server actions and mutation in Next.js 14 which is a powerful feature which can handle form submission and data mutations in Nextjs application. I also learned about Stream library which can help to develop video conferencing app in ease. Implementing them , I developed a video conferencing app with features like:-
- creating meetings having all the features of zoom like :- record meeting, emote, share screen, change layout of the screen, 
- schedule a meeting and invite others by sharing link
- Join a meeting by using existing link
- See recordings of previous meeting

### iPhone 15 landing page
Then I practiced gsap (a javascript animation library ) by  following a comprehensive  tutorial . 
Later I designed 3d landing page of iPhone 15 using React three fiber and gsap.
After completing this project I learned:-
- How to animate a 3d objects using gsap 
- Discovered how to convert GLTFs to JSX components and change its props dynamically to render 3d object with different properties
- Sentry for monitoring performance and tracking of errors

### DSA 

I also learned concepts of Data Structures , practiced problems from Cracking the coding interview book and solved problem on leetcode. I got confidence to solve medium question on leetcode of topics like :- Array and Strings, Linkedlist , Stack/ Queue.
I also learned about Trees , familiarize myself with the iterative and recursive traversal in both BFS and DFS. Now i am solving question related to trees.


In the mean time, i also truly understand some css concepts which I was using it unknowingly and some forgotten concepts. For css trips and tricks, I usually follow Kevin Powell and watch his video regularly and try that myself it in codepen. 

### Ecommerce project 

I was very fascinated about the changes in Nextjs specially in server actions and caching . Before developing this project, I never had experience in stripe. I created a ecommerce website that have following features :-
- Authenticated admin dashboard for managing products and users. 
- Displaying products by sorting them according to the date created and popularity
- Payment integration with Stripe
- Products are downloadable and after purchasing product you get a email
- My Order section to see the orders in tabular form and it also has feature to get email of all the order history

Future plans
- Integrate discount codes 
- Charts and graph for visualization of events for admins


### Learning Rust

For learning rust i followed top 3 resources to learn rust viz. the book (The Rust Book) , rustlings for interactive exercise to learn rust by solving  exercises , Learn Rust by Example is also very helpful. I joined rust community and discord and actively read posts from Rustaceans. I learned rust because I was fascinated by its memory management through ownership and burrow checkers. I have learned upto error handling in rust. In future, I will continue learning rust , create some personal projects and also contribute open source projects. 

For extra info about my the learning process and experience pls follow me on hashnode. @cyberknight

### Javascript

I am confident to solve the problems related to Event loop, iterator and type coersion .

### Go HTMX 

I tried to make go htmx tailwind template. I decided to leave this for now for later.



## Books

In this vacation , I read 3 books.

- Deep Work
- Mind for Numbers
- Happiness Equation

I am planning to write book summary of these books in future. 

## Traveling  

Jomacho hike and Dhulikhel visit



> Due to personal reason and a mistake my plan to visit to my own village was cancelled. I won't repeat this mistake again. 



## Music, Movie/Series and Anime

I started listening to Incubus. "Drive" and "Wish you were here" songs are my favorite. 

Movie : I like to watch thriller movies as my life has been always a thriller which motivates me to live each and every moment.
- Manchester by the sea
- Gone Girl
- Zodiac 
- Silicon Valley
- Se7en


## Important 

- I found something important and implemented in my real life, which is a concept called "Deep Work". "All the shallow works will be replaced by AI ", this saying made me think. I used to listen to music while studying and coding. I stopped listening to music while studying and coding. By doing so , my concentration peaked which make my learning fast and I also started to think about the information conceptually which help me built my intuition. I was solving exercises in rustlings , at first for basic part I used to learn from the rust book and listen to music side by side and while solving rustlings I could not solve even basic questions . But restraining from music while studying I was able to concentrate more and grab more which made me capable of solving rustlings exercise without hints. And I was also able to solve leetcode medium of the topic right after  studying the same topic from Cracking the Coding Interview book without other references.  

Now onwards I will either take a break or do deep work. 

- After reading Book called Deep work. I found something interesting . "Three types of people can survive 21st century  :- 1) Those who have capital 2) Expert in their field 3) Those who can work with technology ." As I am not type 1 , I will focus on type 2 and type 3.
